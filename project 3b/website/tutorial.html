        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Traffic Measurement in the Internet, 
          particularly traffic flow measurement, is an area of rapid growth in 
          recent years, although the issue is not new at all. But many tools have 
          been developed and methodology and technologies have been improved.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">The tutorial first gives an overview 
          of the applications needing IP traffic measurements, listing their requirements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Then, an overview and classification 
          of the several existing measurement techniques is presented, and the 
          generic traffic measurement process is introduced. The challenges of 
          capturing IP packets at link layer level and at network level are discussed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">For traffic metering, there exist 
          several IETF standards (RTFM, IPPM, RMON, IPFIX, PSAMP) and other de-facto 
          standards (e.g. NetFlow). The tutorial gives and overview of these as 
          well as of common low-level metering tools.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">On higher levels of IP traffic 
          measurement, a large variety of tools, frameworks, and systems can be 
          found supporting graphical display of measured flow data, integration 
          and correlation of measurements from different locations, and integration 
          with applications such as traffic engineering and accounting. A<br>
          representative subset of these is presented.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Finally, an outlook is given including 
          recent developments, current activities and challenges ahead. In particular, 
          it is presented the new concept of passive measurements for performance 
          estimation, that enables some interesting applications (trajectory discovery, 
          One way delay estimation) that are difficult or unfeasible to achieve 
          with active measurements.</font></p>

          <b>Speaker's bio</b>: Maurizio Molina received his electronic engineering 
          degree in 1993 from the Polytechnic of Turin, Italy. From 1994 to 2000 
          he worked in the Network Planning and Traffic Engineering department 
          of Telecom Italia's R&amp;D center (TILAB, formerly CSELT), where he 
          participated in the design and evaluation of systems for the measurements, 
          dimensioning and traffic control of IP, ATM and Telephony networks. 
          He contributed to the ITU-T standards for ATM Networks and published 
          papers in the area of IP and WEB traffic modelling. From March 2000 
          to May 2001 he worked at Flextel, an Italian IT and Network equipment 
          start up company. In June 2001 he joined the NEC Network laboratories 
          Europe (in Heidelberg, Germany) where he's currently working in the 
          area of Traffic Measurement and Monitoring. He's a co-author of a draft 
          in the<br>
          IETF PSAMP WG on packet sampling techniques, and contributed to the

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><b>Outline:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">The tutorial presents challenging 
          management issues in increasingly-becoming-smart IP networks. Its journey 
          goes from FCAPS diagnosis functionality inside network devices to complement 
          IP-family protocol-based information, and ends with the most recent 
          ITU and IETF documents on related subjects. The first part introduces 
          what is perceived as missing in the current networks to provide more 
          self-functionality, from both device perspective and interaction perspective. 
          The presentation identifies how distributed FCAPS can be melt into networks 
          and what monitoring procedures are in place to support the paradigm. 
          Particular mechanisms combining Syslog and SNMP IP-oriented information 
          which<br>
          complement the routing protocols' updating functions (OSPF, BGP, etc.) 
          are scrutinized. A particular insight is given to separation of concerns 
          of what is needed in IP networks from the FCAPS perspective to satisfy 
          wish-to-be functions related to preventive, proactive and reactive manageability, 
          as well as to discovery, isolation, and restoration functions in terms 
          inside-IP-networks,<br>
          and inside-FCAPS-managing-applications. Status on different ongoing 
          standards and working groups activities is also presented.</font></p>

          to object-oriented management applications for distributed systems, 
          and to broadband services in<br>
          multimedia applications. As a Researcher at the Computer Science Research 
          Institute of Montreal he coordinated many projects on distributed software 
          and management architectures. In this period he was an Adjunct Professor 
          with McGill University, Montreal, Canada, and a Canadian representative 
          in the European projects. Since 1998 he was with AT&amp;T Labs, as a 
          senior technical manager, focusing on distributed QoS, SLA, and Performance
